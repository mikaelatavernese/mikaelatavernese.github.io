                    <h2 class="resume"><strong style="font-weight:700">Product Design Manager</strong> / February 2023–Present</h2>
                    <p class="resume">Currently, I manage a group of product designers that design GC’s basketball, volleyball, and football experiences. While managing these product designers, I collaborate with cross-functional counterparts on group vision and strategy. I am responsible for ensuring design quality and a consistent end-to-end user experience throughout the group’s projects.  </p>

                    <h2 class="resume"><strong style="font-weight:700">Lead Product Designer</strong> / April 2022–February 2023</h2>
                    <p class="resume">In 2022 my team refocused on the youth coach and scorekeeper persona. We launched features that would elevate their experience as well as increase the number of games being scored in GC like:<a href="https://gc.com/home/post/pitch-velocity-tracking" target="blank"> Pitch Velocity Tracking</a>, <a href="https://gc.com/home/post/family-and-player-scorekeeping" target="blank">Family and Player Scorekeeping</a>, <a href="https://gc.com/home/post/opponent-scorekeeping-for-basketball" target="blank">Opponent Scorekeeping for Basketball</a>, and <a href="https://gc.com/home/post/voice-scorekeeping-for-basketball" target="blank">Voice Scorekeeping for Basketball</a>.</p>
                    <p class="resume">During this time I hired and managed a product designer who focused on launching <a href="https://gc.com/home/post/volleyball-scorekeeping" target="blank">GC’s volleyball scorekeeping experience</a>.</p>

                    <h2 class="resume"><strong style="font-weight:700">Senior Product Designer</strong> / May 2019–April 2022</h2>

                    <p class="resume">I collaborated with a cross-disciplinary team tasked with finding new ways to serve youth sports teams. Initially, I lead the team in deciding which sport we would go after through workshops, user research, and data analysis. After the team decided on basketball as our next sport we narrowed down the possible feature set to our MVP. I designed and tested the MVP <a href="https://gc.com/home/basketball" target="blank">basketball scorekeeping experience</a> before working with the team to build the features on iOS and Android in late 2019. We iterated on the basketball scorekeeping experience and built out a complimentary experience for families and fans to follow the youth basketball games that the coaches would score. </p>
                    <p class="resume">
                    In 2020 in an effort to bring the game closer to fans during a difficult year GC pivoted to focusing on <a href="https://gc.com/home/post/streaming-is-live" target="blank">live video streaming</a>. I was responsible for designing the MVP experience and running a beta testing group. After the initial launch, I passed the feature set to another team and refocused on GC’s scorekeeping features. </p>
                    <p class="resume">
                    In 2021 my team was tasked with getting GC into the hands of coaches for as many sports as possible. We decided to base the architecture and UX on the foundations we created for our basketball features. I designed and tested scorekeeping experiences for <a href="https://gc.com/home/post/gamechanger-adds-scorekeeping-in-7-new-sports" target="blank">soccer, lacrosse, football, hockey, field hockey, rugby, and water polo</a>. The fan experience for these sports would quickly follow.</p>
